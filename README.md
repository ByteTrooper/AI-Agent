## How the Agent Works
The restaurant chatbot agent is designed to handle user interactions for searching restaurants and making reservations. It uses a state management system to process user inputs and transition between different conversation states. Here's a detailed description of how the agent works:

1)State Management:

The chatbot maintains different states to handle various parts of the conversation.
States include THANK_YOU, NORMAL_CONVERSATION, INTENT_DETECTION, and others.
The current state determines how the chatbot processes the user's input.

2)State Transitions:

When the chatbot is in the THANK_YOU state, it transitions to the INTENT_DETECTION state for further processing in the next cycle.
Similarly, in the NORMAL_CONVERSATION state, it transitions to the INTENT_DETECTION state.
The state is updated in the session state to keep track of the conversation flow.

3)Processing User Input:

If the chatbot has not generated a response yet and the state has changed, it processes the new state by calling the process_state function with the user's input and restaurant data.
The process_state function handles the logic for each state and generates an appropriate response.

4)Generating Responses:

If a response is generated, it is returned to the user.
If no response is generated and the state has not changed, the chatbot prompts the user with a default message asking if they want to search for restaurants or make a reservation.

5)Main Function:

The main function is the entry point of the chatbot application.
It initializes the chatbot and starts the conversation loop.
